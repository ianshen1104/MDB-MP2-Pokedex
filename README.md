# Pokedex Mini Project

A Pokedex app that includes all 800+ Pokemons up to generation 7. The main page allows the user to switch between a grid view and a row view at ease. It also includes a search bar where the user can search for a particular pokemon by name. If the "Advance Search" button is pressed, the app segues to a different view where the user can specify specific ranges for each stats value and select an unlimited number of types. There is also an "Random" button that randomly generates 20 pokemons. When a cell entry is pressed, the app segues to a profile page that shows the name, id, image, gif image, and general stats of the selected pokemon.

Features:
Navigation Bar Control
Dynamic Search Bar
Advanced Search with Attributes
Dynamically Changing Constraints & Stack Axis to switch between Row and Grid
Protocals and Delegates to send back filter object when navigating back
